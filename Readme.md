# Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether a telecom customer is likely to churn. The model uses customer behavior, demographics, and service usage data to classify churn status.

Project Structure

# Problem Statement

Customer churn is a critical issue for telecom companies. Predicting whether a customer is at risk of leaving helps businesses take proactive retention actions. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that identifies customers who are likely to churn.
